Before you begin, make sure you've got [Google App Engine SDK](https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads) installed.

You'll need a Twitter account, with development API keys, and a Twilio account for sending SMS notifications.

1. Get the code

        git clone https://github.com/balanced/status.balancedpayments.com.git
        cd status.balancedpayments.com

2. Update `situation/settings.py` and provide your Twitter and Twilio API credentials. Also, update the email sender to your desired address. NOTE: You must add the sender e-mail address into Google App Engine as an administrator of the application. Read further details at (https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/mail/)

3. Run the local development server

        dev_appserver.py situation/

4. Visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to view the page

5. If you want to deploy this to your own GAE account, edit [`app.yaml`](https://github.com/balanced/status.balancedpayments.com/blob/master/situation/app.yaml), change the name of the app (`situation-staging`) to your own app name and then run

        appcfg.py update situation/

If you want to use this for your own, you'll need to point it at your own graphite server and add your own Twitter and Twillio credentials into [settings.py](https://github.com/balanced/status.balancedpayments.com/blob/master/situation/settings.py).
