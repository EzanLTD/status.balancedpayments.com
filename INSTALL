Before you begin, make sure you've got [Google App Engine SDK](https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads) installed.

1. Get the code

        git clone https://github.com/balanced/status.balancedpayments.com.git
        cd status.balancedpayments.com

2. Run the local development server

        dev_appserver.py situation/

3. Visit [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to view the page
4. To pull data from our test Twitter account, run this curl command

        curl http://localhost:8000/twitter -d update=1 -u username:password

5. If you want to deploy this to your own GAE account, edit [`app.yaml`](https://github.com/balanced/status.balancedpayments.com/blob/master/situation/app.yaml#L1), change the name of the app (`situation-demo`) to your own app name and then run

        appcfg.py update situation/

If you want to use this for your own, you'll need to point it at your own graphite server and add your own Twitter app credentials into [settings.py](https://github.com/balanced/status.balancedpayments.com/blob/master/situation/settings.py#L6).

Finally, you'll need to setup a cron job or some other sort of scheduled task which will `POST` to the `/twitter` and `/uptime` URLs to pull data into the system.
